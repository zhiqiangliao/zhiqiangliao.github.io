(1) L0 norm ($$\|\theta\|_0$$)

The zero norm (also known as $$l_0$$ norm, L0 norm) of a vector $$\theta \in \{1,...,d\}$$ is denoted $$\|\theta\|_0$$ and is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq: l0}
\lVert\theta\lVert_0 = \sum_{j=1}^d \mathbb{I}(\theta_j \neq 0)
\end{equation}

where $$\mathbb{I}(\cdot)$$ is an [indicator function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_function). Thus, L0 norm indicate the number of nonzero elements in $$\theta$$.

(2) L1 norm ($$\|\theta\|_1$$)

The one norm (also known as the $$l_1$$ norm, L1 norm, or mean norm) of a vector $$\theta \in \{1,...,d\}$$ is denoted $$\|\theta\|_1$$ and is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq: l1}
\lVert\theta\lVert_1 = \sum_{j=1}^d \lvert\theta_j\lvert
\end{equation}

Thus, L1 norm is defined as the sum of the absolute values of its elements.

(3) L2 norm ($$\|\theta\|_2$$)

The two norm (also known as the $$l_2$$ norm, L2 norm, or mean-square norm, least squares norm) of a vector $$\theta \in \{1,...,d\}$$ is denoted $$\|\theta\|_2$$ and is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq: l2}
\lVert\theta\lVert_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^d \lvert\theta_j\lvert^2}
\end{equation}

L2 norm is defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its elements.

(4) Infinity norm  ($$\|\theta\|_{\infty}$$)

The infinity norm (also known as the $$l_{\infty}$$ norm, max norm, or uniform norm) of a vector $$\theta \in \{1,...,d\}$$ is denoted $$\|\theta\|_2$$ and is defined as follows:

$$
\begin{equation}
\label{eq: linf}
\|\theta\|_{\infty} = \max_{j=1,...,d} \{|\theta_j|\}
\end{equation}
$$

$$L_{\infty}$$ norm is defined as the maximum of the absolute values of its elements.

(5) Lp norm  ($$\|\theta\|_{p}$$)

The p norm (also known as the $$l_p$$ norm, Lp norm) of a vector $$\theta \in \{1,...,d\}$$ is denoted $$\|\theta\|_p$$ and is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq: lp}
\lVert\theta\lVert_p = \sqrt[p]{\sum_{j=1}^d \lvert\theta_j\lvert^p}
\end{equation}
