I am currently a PhD student at the [Department of Information and Service Management](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-information-and-service-management) at [Aalto University School of Business](https://www.aalto.fi/en/school-of-business). 

My research interests focus on Statistical Machine Learning, Production Economics, and Nonparametric econometrics. I am also interested in their applications to electricity market, energy and sustainble development.

Before joining Aalto BIZ, I obtained my master degree in Business school at [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/). My master dissertation title is "Fuzzy support vector machine for preference learning and its application".

Here you can find my [publications page](/publications/) and my [CV](/cv/). Please feel free to contact me.
